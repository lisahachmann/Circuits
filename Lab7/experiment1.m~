%% experiment 1

%include a single plot showing I1, I2, I1 − I2, and I1 + I2, as a function of V1 − V2 for 
%all three values of V2 that you used. 








%Also include a plot showing the common-source node voltage,
%V , as a function of V1 − V2 for all three values of V2. 


%For each of the three values of V2 that you used, fit a straight line to the plot of 
%I1 −I2 as a function of V1 − V2 around the region where V1 ≈ V2 (i.e., 
%where V1 − V2 ≈ 0). The slope of this line is approximately equal to the
%(incremental) differential-mode transconductance gain of the differential 
%pair, which is formally given by diff (I1 - I2) / diff(V1-V2)


%Make plot similar to the ones that you made for the lower bias current
