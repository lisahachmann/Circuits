%experiment 2
%Fit a straight line to the steep part of the curve and determine the 
%differential-mode voltage gain of your circuit from the slope
%of the best-fit line. In your report, include a plot showing Vout versus Vdm 
%along with the best-fit line.

% Fit a straight line to the shallow part of this output currentâ€“voltage
% characteristic, which should correspond to the range of output voltages over
% which the gain of the circuit is large, and determine the
% incremental output resistance of the circuit from the slope of the best-fit
% line. In your report,include a plot showing the output current-voltage 
% characteristic along with the best-fit line.
