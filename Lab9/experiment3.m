% Apply a small-amplitude square wave to the input of your circuit and observe both the
%input and output waveforms as a function of time.
%Extract a time constant both for the up-going and for the down-going
%output transitions. How do these compare with that which you compute from the measured
%values of the load capacitance and the differential-mode transconductance gain that you
%found in Experiment 2? In your report, include a single plot showing both scope traces
%along with the extracted time constants.




%Next, increase the amplitude of your square wave so that it is a couple of volts.
%You will probably notice that the output
%of the amplifier follows a linear trajectory in time over most of its response 
%to the large input step. This behavior is called slewing, and the constant rate
%of change of the output voltage with respect to time is called the slew rate 
%of the amplifier. Extract a slew rate for both for the up-going and for the down-going 
%output transitions. How do these compare with those which you compute from the load 
%capacitance and the limiting values of the output current?
%In your report, include a single plot showing both scope traces along with 
%the extracted slew rates.
